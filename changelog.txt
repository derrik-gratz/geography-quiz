### **🏗️ Architecture & State Management**
- **Implemented custom hooks pattern** instead of single appState object

  - Accepts available countries as parameter (separation of concerns)

### **🧩 Component Structure**
- **Created QuizConfig component** (`src/components/QuizConfig.jsx`)
  - Dropdown for quiz set selection
  - Clean separation of UI from logic
  - Proper accessibility with labels and IDs

### **📊 Data Integration**
- **Integrated quiz_sets.json** data into useQuizConfig hook
- **Integrated country_wikipedia_data.json** for "All countries" option
- **Implemented derived state logic** for available countries based on quiz set selection

### **�� Core Functionality**
- **Added prompt generation button** in main App component
- **Implemented random country selection** from available countries
- **Added current prompt display** in UI
- **Connected quiz engine to UI** through proper event handling

### **🔧 Technical Improvements**
- **Separated business logic from UI** (hooks vs components)
- **Implemented proper React patterns** (useCallback, useMemo, custom hooks)
- **Added proper prop drilling** for data flow
- **Maintained clean separation of concerns** throughout

### **📁 File Structure Created**
```
src/
├── App.jsx                    # Main app component
├── App.css                    # Basic styling
├── components/
│   └── QuizConfig.jsx         # Quiz configuration UI
├── hooks/

└── data/
    ├── quiz_sets.json         # Quiz set definitions
    └── country_wikipedia_data.json # Country data
```

### **🎯 Key Design Decisions**
- **Hooks for logic, components for UI** - Clean separation
- **Derived state in hooks** - Single source of truth
- **Props for data flow** - React best practices
- **Small, focused files** - Better maintainability
- **Quiz engine unaware of quiz sets** - Better abstraction

### **🚀 Current State**
- ✅ Basic app structure with clean architecture
- ✅ Quiz set selection working
- ✅ Prompt generation from available countries
- ✅ "All countries" option functional
- ✅ Proper state management with custom hooks
- ✅ Clean component separation

The app now has a solid foundation with proper React patterns and is ready for adding more features like input methods, progress tracking, and game logic!
