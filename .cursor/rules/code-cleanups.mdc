When asked to clean up code, conform to standard React quidelines. E.g.:

React components should follow this layout:

    Props interface at top
    Component as named export
    Styles at bottom

Additionally, suggest how code can be moved to improve rendering speed or otherwise conform best-practices for web dev.

Add comments that explain how concepts like State etc are being managed.
