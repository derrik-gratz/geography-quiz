# Roadmap

# Housekeeping

- Review 'available prompts' for countries with duplicate flags

- Cleanup sets, make sure correct countries are included

# Future feature plans

- Learning mode: selecting an answer in one window displays the answers in the other one. 

- Allow user to challenge themselves on only one type of response. E.g., only guessing flags, maps, names, etc.

- Fix contries found in geographies but not in countries

- Group like flags with multiple country codes (eg FR)

- Create groups of countries for challenges. Also possibly blacklist common countries
